# Random GIF Fetcher and Search with Giphy API

This React project provides two functionalities:

1. Fetch and display random GIFs using the Giphy API.
2. Search for GIFs based on a query and display a random result.

## Features

- **Random GIF Fetcher**: Fetches a random GIF from Giphy on page load and allows the user to generate a new random GIF with a button click.
- **GIF Search**: Fetches and displays random GIFs based on a search query. Each time you click the "Generate New GIF" button, a new GIF related to the search term is displayed.
- **Loading Spinner**: Displays a loading spinner while the GIF is being fetched.
